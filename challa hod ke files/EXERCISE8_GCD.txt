EXERCISE : WRITE A RECURSIVE PYTHON CODE SNIPPET TO FIND GCD OF 2 NUMBERS

CODE SNIPPET :

def gcd(a,b):
    if a == 0 :
        return b
    elif b == 0 :
        return a
    else:
        return(gcd(b,a%b))
a = int(input("Enter a "))
b = int(input("Enter b "))
print("The gcd of",a,"and",b,"is",gcd(a,b))

 O U T P U T

Enter a 20
Enter b 40
The gcd of 20 and 40 is 20

Process finished with exit code 0
